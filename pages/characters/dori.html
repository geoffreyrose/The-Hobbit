<h1>Dori</h1>
<section>
<img class="charimg" src="img/characters/dori.jpg" alt="Dori the Dwarf" />
	<p>Dori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk, who along with his brothers Nori and Ori travelled with Bilbo Baggins as a member of Thorin and Company in The Quest of Erebor to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.
	</p>
	<p>Dori had a flute that he played in Bilbo's home before leaving on their journey. He was said to like food as much as Bilbo or any hobbit, and was described by the narrative as "a decent fellow, despite his grumbling." Dori was the strongest of the company of dwarves. He usually wore a purple-hooded cloak when traveling abroad.
