	<p>Gandalf the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, also known as Olórin (Quenya Tengwar: full spelling `Nj~N7T5 or vowel-abbreviated spelling `NjYN7T5; IPA: [oˈloːrin]), Tharkun, and Mithrandir (Sindarin IPA: [miˈθrandir]), was an Istar. Istari were Maiar that were specially chosen by the Valar to help aid the people of Middle-earth in the fight against evil. The Istari (Men called them Wizards) took the form of Men, but possessed much greater physical and mental power. For over 2,000 years, Gandalf worked most faithfully against the rising powers of evil in Middle-earth.
