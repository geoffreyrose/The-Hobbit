<h1>Bilbo Baggins</h1>

<img class="charimg" src="img/characters/bilbo.jpg" alt="Bilbo the hobbit" />
	<p>Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit, and the main protagonist in The Hobbit; he was hired by Thorin and Company to be their burglar on the Quest of Erebor, and he fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. He was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up to Gandalf, though with some difficulty. He wrote of his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his nephew Frodo Baggins after his father Drogo Baggins, Bilbo's second cousin ended up drowning in the Brandywine River; and not long after adopting the orphaned Frodo did he become the sole heir to Bag End. Bilbo was the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large and one of the few to visit the The Undying Lands.
